## STEPS TO CREATE YOUR OWN

### npm init

Start a new `node` project and name it whatever you want. You could choose to name it after the executable you want to expose. Itâ€™s not necessary but conventions are nice, and it makes your binary more `npx` friendly.

```bash
mkdir angry_pickle_guy
cd angry_pickle_guy
npm init -y
touch card.js
chmod +x card.js
```

Now open the new file in your favorite editor. Iâ€™ve been using `VisualStudio Code`.

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node

console.log('doing business')
```

Be creative and add logic to create your own card in `card.js` file.
or you can simply copy my `card.js` file and make necessary changes as required

#### ship it

Thatâ€™s an entirely functional first release! You just need to modify your `package.json` to let `npm` know to link your executable and you are off:

```json
{
  // ...
  "bin": "./card.js",
  // ....
}
```

By default, `npm` will expose your binary using the same name as your package

Share your new CLI with the world!

```bash
npm version patch
npm publish
```

Now anyone can leverage your new CLI using `npx`, without needing to install it locally:

```bash
npx $YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME
```

Now you have a globally executable script, that can leverage all of `npm`, to perform awesome utilities (or silly ideas like this). If you find you are writing a â€˜bigâ€™ CLI with lots of parameters or sub-commands, you will want more options around how to define your CLI and should consider trying [yargs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yargs) instead of [minimist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minimist).
